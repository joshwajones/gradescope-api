"""A library for programmatically interacting with Gradescope.

The most useful features are likely extensions (see Course, Extension, and Assignment)
and downloading/exporting (see Assignment).

Some Question functionality is included. However, it is not tested, or particularly useful;
this I have simply copied from https://github.com/apozharski/gradescope-api.
